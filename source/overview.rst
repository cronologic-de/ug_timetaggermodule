Module Overview
===============

`cronologic <https://www.cronologic.de>`_ offers multiple variants of the
`TimeTagger4 <https://www.cronologic.de/product/timetagger>`_ boards, offering
the following quantization (bin size):

- **TimeTagger4-1.25G**:  800 ps
- **TimeTagger4-2.5G**:   400 ps
- **TimeTagger4-5G**:     200 ps
- **TimeTagger4-10G**:    100 ps

Each of these variants is available as a modular version, as well, offering:

**Space-saving installation**
    All TimeTagger modules can be installed via board-to-board connectors with 
    minimal hardware effort.

**Integrate at minimum cost**
    Our TimeTagger4 TDC modules are the perfect choice if you are looking for
    picosecond resolution at the best possible price/performance ratio.

**Bipolar design**
    TDC modules can be combined with a wide range of detectors or constant 
    fraction discriminators (CFD) as their threshold discriminators utilize 
    positive or negative thresholds with configurable voltage.

**Use the TiGer timing generator**
    Control your device with periodic pulse patterns, the exact timing of which
    is measured by the TDC. You can use any input channel of our module to 
    output these pulses.
