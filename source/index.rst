   \chapter{Introduction}

The compact `TimeTagger modules <https://www.cronologic.de/product/tdc-modules>`_ 
from `cronologic <https://www.cronologic.de>`_ provide a practical solution 
to the challenge of significantly **reducing space requirements in 
measurement setups and analyzers** without sacrificing performance and 
accuracy. They can be integrated via customer-specific analog front ends.

The **TimeTagger modules** offer the same functionality as cronologic's 
`TimeTagger PCIe boards <https://www.cronologic.de/product/timetagger>`_.
As such, they are ideally suitable in applications that do require a
**compact form factor**, **high data-acquisition** rates,
and low **multiple-hit** dead time.

This User Guide provides an overview of the modules operation and installation
requirements. An overview of the **functionality** and the **C API** can be 
found in the `TimeTagger4 User Guide 
<https://download.cronologic.de/TimeTagger/TimeTagger4_User_Guide.pdf>`_.

This User Guide is also available as `PDF download 
<https://docs.cronologic.de/_/downloads/timetagger_modules/en/latest/pdf/>`_.

The user guides of all products by cronologic GmbH & Co. KG are available 
online at `docs.cronologic.de <https://docs.cronologic.de>`_.
