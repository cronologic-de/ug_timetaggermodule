Manufacturer
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The device is a product of:

    | **cronologic** GmbH & Co. KG

Intended Use and System Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The devices are **not ready to use as delivered** by cronologic. It requires 
the development of **carrier boards** and **specialized software** to fulfill
the application-needs of the end-user.
The device is provided to system integrators to be built into measurement
systems that are distributed to end users. These systems usually consist of the
TimeTagger Module integrated on a PCIe carrier board, a main board, a case, 
application software and possibly additional
electronics to attach the system to some type of detector. They might also be
integrated with the detector. 

The TimeTagger Module is designed to comply with **DIN EN 61326-1** when
operated on a PCIe compliant main board housed in a properly
shielded enclosure. When operated in a closed standard compliant enclosure, the
device does not pose any hazards as defined by **EN 61010-1**. 

Radiated emissions,
noise immunity, and safety highly depend on the quality of the enclosure. It is
the responsibility of the system integrator to ensure that the assembled system
is compliant to applicable standards of the country that the system is operated
in, especially with regard to user safety and electromagnetic interference. 

When handling the board, adequate measures must be taken to protect the
circuits against electrostatic discharge (ESD). All power supplied to the
system must be turned off before installing the board
