   This User Guide is under active development.

The compact `TimeTagger modules <https://www.cronologic.de/product/tdc-modules>`_ 
from `cronologic <https://www.cronologic.de>`_ provide a practical solution 
to the challenge of significantly **reducing space requirements in 
measurement setups and analyzers** without sacrificing performance and 
accuracy. They can be integrated via customer-specific analog front ends.

The **TimeTagger modules** offer the same functionality as cronologic's 
`TimeTagger PCIe boards <https://www.cronologic.de/product/timetagger>`_.
As such, they are ideally suitable in applications that do require **high
data-acquisition** rates and **low multiple-hit dead time**.

This User Guide provides an overview of the modules operation and installation
requirements. An overview of the functionality and the C API can be found
in the `TimeTagger4 User Guide 
<https://download.cronologic.de/TimeTagger/TimeTagger4_User_Guide.pdf>`_.
